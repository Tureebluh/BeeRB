## Acknowledgments

* I set out to make a program that streamers could use to play custom videos for their audience without the hassle of editing and rendering video through traditional means. I've included a few image sketchups showing the evolution of the software that's kind of neat to check out.

* Huge thanks to family and friends that helped test and give feedback. The program wouldn't be where it is today otherwise.

* You can download the Windows installer of BeeRB [here](https://www.tureebluh.com/beerb)
